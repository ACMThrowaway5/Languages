# Languages
Some examples of languages I am actively using this semester.
I promise there's some interesting stuff hidden in a few places in this repo. Not much but a few hints. More than just what's in the print statements.
Thinks have changed in this repo since yesterday. Hopefully, you check around again.

Lol I definitely didn't mess up creating one of the things as an issue instead of a PR. I'm not too tired for this.
